So, just as a blueprint defines the structure and characteristics of a building, a class defines the properties and behavior that objects of that class should have. **Once we create an object from a class, that object has its own unique state and behavior, but it also inherits the properties and behavior defined in the class.**\n",

The compiler uses the class definition to generate code that will create objects of that class at runtime, but the class itself is not an object and does not have a memory allocation.\n",

    "But **the way memory is allocated to variables(objects) and functions(methods) of the class is different** even though they both are from the same class.\n",
