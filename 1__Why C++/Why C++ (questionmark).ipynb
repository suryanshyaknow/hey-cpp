    "C++ is often considered an **`intermediate-level`** language because it combines features of both **\"high-level\"** and **\"low-level\"** languages.\n",

    "- On the one hand, C++ provides **high-level abstractions** that make it easy to write code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain. \n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, C++ supports **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts such as classes and objects, which allow you to organize your code into modular, reusable components. It also supports **templates**, which enable generic programming and make it possible to write code that works with many different types of data.<br><br>\n",

    "- On the other hand, C++ also provides **low-level features that allow us to interact directly with hardware and memory**. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    For example, C++ allows us to work with **pointers**, **which are variables that store memory addresses and can be used to manipulate data directly in memory**. This gives us fine-grained control over memory management and can be important for performance-critical applications such as device drivers or embedded systems programming."

    "1. **Performance:** C++ is a **compiled** language, which means that it can execute much faster than an interpreted language like Python. This can be important for algorithms that need to process large amounts of data.<br><br>\n",

    "    **For example**, we can use C++ to write device drivers that control hardware devices such as printers, scanners, and cameras. These drivers can communicate with the hardware directly and perform precise operations to control the device's behavior.<br><br>\n",
